Employment growth is slowing, with downward revisions to the previous two months reports. Worker productivity and employment growth determine how fast the economy grows. Absent a sustained increase in worker efficiency, a decline in employment growth could result in stalling output, putting the economy at greater risk of recession. \\\n",
